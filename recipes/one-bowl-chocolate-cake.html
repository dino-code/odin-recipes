        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe for chocolate cake by user shirleyo that I found on AllRecipes. The photo looked really good. It's something I want to try baking one day.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; mix for 2 minutes on medium speed with an electric mixer.</li>
            <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin.</li>
            <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
